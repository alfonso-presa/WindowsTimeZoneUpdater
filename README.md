# WindowsTimeZoneUpdater
Automatically change your time zone in windows 8

To use this, right now you need to create an account in https://askgeo.com, and set the ASKGEO_ACCOUNT_ID and ASKGEO_ACCOUNT_KEY to the values they provide.

You can also both run the detectTimeZone.ps1 file, or run the vbs wrapper. This last one is specially useful if you want to run it from an automatic task as it will not pop up a powershell window.
